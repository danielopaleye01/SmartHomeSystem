Zachary began work on a wiring diagram for the Proof of Concept Prototype in TinkerCAD.

  3/10/2025
Zachary finalized the wiring diagram.
Zachary and Jameela assembled, programmed, and tested the Proof of Concept Prototype.
  Test 1: Initial test of prototype
    The power and ground leads in the PIR motion sensor were reversed.
    The issue prevented the rest of the system from functioning.
  Test 2: Fixed incorrect motion sensor wiring
    The lights LED activated when the motion sensor was tripped.
    The temperature and humididty sensor registered input.
    The wire connecting the HVAC indicator LED was faulty and prevented the component from activating.
  Test 3: Replaced faulty wire
    The lights LED activated when the motion sensor was tripped.
    The temperature/humidity sensor was already at 80 degrees Fahrenheit and the HVAC LED activated.
    Cold water was obtained to cool the temperature/humidity sensor down until the HVAC LED deactivated.
    The HVAC LED reactivated once the temperature/humidity sensor heated up again.
